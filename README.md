# LiriNodeApp

 LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


LIRI can take in one of the following commands in the arguments:
spotify-this-song, movie-this, do-what-it-says.




The spotify-this-song `'<song name here>'` command.
This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window
Artist(s), the song's name, a preview link of the song from Spotify, the album that the song is from 




The movie-this `'<movie name here>'` command.
This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:
  * Title of the movie.
  * Year the movie came out.
  * IMDB Rating of the movie.
  * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
  * Country where the movie was produced.
  * Language of the movie.
  * Plot of the movie.
  * Actors in the movie.

  There will also be outputs for it the user types in just the commands alone!

  PS. do-what-it says, try it and have fun with it!
